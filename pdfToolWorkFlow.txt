🔁 How Professionals Design Web App Workflows
    Step 1: ✍️ Define Product Structure (Information Architecture)
        mathematica:
            Top Bar:
            - 📖 Reader
                - Open PDF (sidebar)
                - Zoom In/Out (sidebar)
                - Go to Page (sidebar)
            - ✏️ Editor
                - Add Text (sidebar)
                - Highlight (sidebar)
                - Insert Image (sidebar)
            - 🌐 Translator
                - Detect Text (sidebar)
                - Translate to Language (sidebar)
                - Export as PDF (sidebar)
        🛠 Tools:
            ✏️ Pen & paper – still powerful for quick thinking
            🗂 Notion / Google Docs – write structure in outlines or tables
            🧱 Miro or Whimsical – for making visual hierarchies
            📌 Tip: If solo, you can just sketch or make a bulleted list.

    Step 2: 🧭 Create a Navigation Flowchart
    Visualize the layout logic and UI transitions:
        User opens website
        │
        ├── Top bar appears (Reader | Editor | Translator)
        │
        ├── User selects "Editor"
        │     ↓
        │   Sidebar appears:
        │   ├── Add Text
        │   ├── Highlight
        │   └── Insert Image
        │
        ├── User selects a tool → content loads in main panel
        │
        └── Top bar always visible → allows switching global context
    This helps separate:
        Global context switching → top nav
        Specific tool choice → sidebar
    🎯 Goal: Understand interaction steps and state changes
    🛠 Tools:
        🔄 Excalidraw (https://excalidraw.com) – easy, sketch-style flowcharts
        🔷 Lucidchart / Whimsical – drag-and-drop flow diagrams
        🧭 Figma (flow view) – allows linking UI blocks with arrows
        📌 Free & easy for now: Use Excalidraw + screenshot your flow.

    Step 3: 📐 Sketch Layout (Wireframe)
    Design low-fidelity wireframes to get the structure clear before you code.
    mathematica:
        +-------------------------------------------------------+
        |  🔖 PDF Tool        | Reader | Editor | Translator    | ← top bar
        +---------------------+-------------------------------+
        | 🧰 Sidebar          |       Main Workspace Area      |
        | [ Add Text     ]    |                               |
        | [ Highlight     ]   |        PDF or tools UI        |
        | [ Insert Image ]    |                               |
        +---------------------+-------------------------------+
    🎯 Goal: Visualize layout without detailed UI design
    🛠 Tools:
        🖼 Figma – professional-grade, free for individuals
        ✏️ Balsamiq – low-fidelity wireframes (drag-and-drop)
        ✍️ Paper or iPad – quick mockups are okay too
        📌 Figma is the best long-term skill to learn here.

    Step 4: 📱 Responsive Design Thinking (Breakpoints)
        Think about how this layout behaves on:
            Desktop: Top bar + left sidebar + main content
            Tablet: Maybe collapsible sidebar
            Mobile: Top nav turns into hamburger menu, sidebar overlays
            You can plan breakpoints early even before code.
        🎯 Goal: Avoid broken layouts on small screens
    🛠 Tools:
        🧩 Figma – set frames for multiple devices (mobile/tablet/desktop)
        🌐 DevTools in browser – test layout breakpoints
        📱 Responsively App – view all device sizes at once (free)
        📌 In your layout plan, consider:
            Should the sidebar collapse on mobile?
            Should the top bar turn into a dropdown?

    Step 5: 🧠 Design Component Behavior
    Before building, define how parts behave:
        Component	Behavior
        Top Bar	Fixed, visible always, highlights active mode
        Sidebar	Only visible after user selects a mode
        Main Panel	Loads content dynamically based on selected tool
        State	Store current function type (e.g., mode = 'editor')
        Routing	Optional: use query string (?mode=reader&tool=zoom) to persist UI
    🧠 Summary: Your New App Layout
    Navigation Roles:
        🔝 Top bar: Select major function (Reader / Editor / Translator)
        📚 Sidebar: Select tool within that function
        🧾 Main area: Show tool UI (e.g., canvas, upload, buttons)
    User Flow:
        Visit site → top bar shown
        Click "Reader" → sidebar appears with tools like "Open PDF"
        Click "Open PDF" → file upload + canvas shown in main area
    🎯 Goal: Plan reusable behaviors & transitions
        🛠 Tools:
        ⚙️ Figma + Prototyping – link pages to simulate interactions
        🧠 Your notes or whiteboard – describe how each UI reacts to clicks
    📌 Document things like:
        When user clicks "Editor" → sidebar opens → “Add Text” tool loads

    ✅ Summary Table
        Step	                    | Purpose	                            | Common Tools (Free)
        1. Info Architecture        | Define sections and tools	            | Notion, Docs, Miro, Pen & paper
        2. User Flow                | Show how user moves through app	    | Excalidraw, Whimsical, Figma Flow view
        3. Wireframe/Layout         | Visual layout of topbar/sidebar/views | Figma, Balsamiq, Excalidraw
        4. Responsive Planning      | Handle different screen sizes	        | Figma frames, DevTools, Responsively App
        5. Component Logic/Behavior	| Define interactions	                |Figma, notes, markdown

    Would you like me to:

    Make a real wireframe mockup in Excalidraw or Figma style?

    Then help you refactor your existing project to follow this structure?

    Let’s design it well before we code it right 😊
